            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>At 19, I embarked on a journey to serve my community, becoming one of the youngest elected officials in New Jersey. As Commissioner of Parks and Public Property in Ridgefield Park, I am committed to enhancing our public spaces and fostering community engagement. My academic pursuits in political science at Bergen Community College and Rutgers University have equipped me with the knowledge and skills to drive meaningful change.</p>
            <p>In addition to my role as Commissioner, I serve on the New Jersey Department of Children and Families Youth Council, advising on improving DCF programs and encouraging youth participation in decisions affecting children and families. I have also interned with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the District 37 Legislative Office, and worked on several political campaigns in and around Bergen County.</p>
